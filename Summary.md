## Summary


## Problem
Semester long project where worked as a consultant for a major media conglomerate. Had a lot of issues they wanted solved. Increase viewership, wanted optimize their studio space, identify new topics. A lot of things wanted to do but no specific direction.

## Timeline

The intial data was given after the first week of classes. Halfway through the semester, we presented a proposal to to our client about possible directions we could take the project:

Based on feedback received from the client, we proceeded to refine our direction over the next month. We then submitted a proof of concept of our solution:

Our final solution, along with the data analysis and market research of our project, was presented in the final presentation:

Note that for all material, the name of our client and its competitors have been censored for confidentiality reasons. 


## Challenges

Gave us some outputted data from one of their models and no other information about the model or how it was created. We basically had to make the project.

Difficult from beginning to end. had to be resourceful and scrape our own data, create our own direction with the project. Difficulty was in managing the scope of the project
Have to use resourcefulness to extract data wherever/whenever you can from other sources, work around it.
Also some teammate issues and arguing.

## Scope

## Technical Analysis

Designed and created a topic modeling augmentation algorithm to facilitate topic selection for content generation and management. Scraped external closed captioning data and used  sentiment analysis, unstructured text analysis, time series analysis, etc. to identify trends in topics and potential topics for news coverage, generate revenue, and create opportunities for improved studio usage.

## Solution

Successful in taking something undefined delivering a project with a tangible monetary impact!
